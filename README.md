## My process
1. Firts and the most important part i think is to know which is the main container of the component, from there i can start building the inner section of the rest. 
- Main Container, Firts block, Second block.

I always enjoy to much building in HTML this type of designs that looks this nice.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - SCSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap 5

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### Continued development

I keep in mind this kind of component for React. I think the best way to build components is React. Im very excited in made more animations for my projects is something that have to implement more often.

Right now i'm focused in doing all type of projects to have something more than work projects in private repos to show.
